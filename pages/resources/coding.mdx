# Coding challenges

> A great way to improve your skills when learning to code is by solving coding challenges. Solving different types of challenges and puzzles can help you become a better problem solver, learn the intricacies of a programming language, prepare for job interviews, learn new algorithms, and more.

## Pizza & Programming

CMUQ has a tradition of [Pizza & Programming competitions](https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/cs/icpc/), where the students have the chance to practice their problem solving and coding skills, and eat some pizza.

> The contests are organized in the same format as [ICPC](https://icpc.global/), one of the world’s most prestigious programming competitions. You can participate with a team of up to three people. 
> Each team will have only one computer, and there is no internet access. The problems can be solved in C, C++, Python, or Java. 
> During the competition, the documentations for all of those languages are available on your machine.
