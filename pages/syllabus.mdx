## Methodology

During a series of presentations, freshman CS majors meet and hear from different members of the SCS community. The speakers talk about our school, their research in CS, the history of computing, and future trends. The goal is to expand the students' concepts of what is Computer Science and what resources are available to them as students within the School of Computer Science.

Preparation for each of these talks and active participation will be stressed upon. We will also be exposed to initial presentation skills in this course. In addition, this course is a place to build community among the Freshman class, and to extend their horizons within and beyond CMU.

## Staff

<Staff withCA={false}/>

Please note: The number one way of guaranteeing to find me is through an appointment. Email me to setup a meeting and you will have my undivided attention during this time. However, I am often available at times other than the appointment as well. I also have an open-door policy, so if my door is open and I am inside, you are more than welcome. At times, I have a stopper at my door, that translates to an open door too.

<Callout>I'm here to help. Do take advantage of it. </Callout>

## Pre-requisites

None. This course is designed as a **"first exposure"** course.

## Websites

The class [website](/), will provide a wealth of up-to-date information about the course.

You should visit it frequently, and keep an eye on the announcements page. If an announcement is up online, I assume that it has been read by the next class when we meet.

## Course Attendance

Attendance is expected at all classes. Being on time is also expected. **Being late is counted as an absence.**

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">Class starts at **{startTime} {startTimeLabel}**, "Late" means that you enter class at or after **{startTime}:01**.</Callout>

## Grading

Grading rules can be found [here](/grading).

## Diversity and Inclusion

**We must treat every individual with respect.** We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:


- **Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion:** [csdi@andrew.cmu.edu](csdi@andrew.cmu.edu), (412) 268-2150
- [Report-It](https://www.reportit.net/) online anonymous reporting platform: username: `tartans` password: `plaid`

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
